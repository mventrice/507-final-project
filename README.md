# Mariele's Music Flask App

## Description

Mariele's Music Flask web application lets users select a genre and a preferred category (e.g. most popular, most obscure, most danceable, slowest temp, more danceable, random). It then displays the top 10 results for those selections in a table that includes the track name, album name, artist name, an image of the artist, and Spotify ratings/assessments for popularity, tempo, and danceability. Then, the user selects one of those 10 tracks. If a music video is available, the user can choose between following a link to the music video on YouTube or following a link to the open Spotify web player. If there are no music videos available, the app says so and offers the Spotify link only. Iâ€™ve also embedded the YouTube videos, if they exist. However, the embedded videos will not play on the local Flask development server.
